The kinds of APIs we will use here can be used to interact with, and get data from, different web platforms using Python. Some APIs are more public than others.\n",

    "Using APIs to request data is usually done through HTTP (see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) for an overview of basic terms). The guide to the Google Books API can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/books/).\n",
